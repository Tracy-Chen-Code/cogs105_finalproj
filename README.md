# cogs105 intro to stats learning final project
This is the final project of Cogs105 (Intro to stats learning). This project is collaborated with Aiden Hai. We fristly work on the ADHD dataset from HBN and would like to figure out how distance matrix work in high-dementional resting-state fMRI dataset (functional connectivity), which is in the folder finalproj_ADHD. But we found the results is not what we expect. Thus, we also did another version of final report on a UCI machine learning adult data which is in the folder finalproj_adult
